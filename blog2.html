        The demand of User experience or more popularly known as UX, is at an
        all-time high.
        <br /><br />
        Recently I came across Google’s UX Design Professional Certificate and
        honestly, before starting with the course, I had no idea about the
        popularity of this field and the growing demand of UX designers and
        researchers.

      <h3>What does User Experience mean?</h3>
      <p>
        User Experience is, as the name suggests, user’s experience. It is about
        making websites, apps and other pieces of technologies as user friendly
        as possible. Many of us have a wrong perception of it being something
        which makes the website look colourful or attractive, but giving
        artistic look to a website or a product is not the primary goal of UX,
        function is. More specifically, making the product as user friendly as
        possible.

      <h3>UX Researchers and Designers</h3>
      <p>
        UX researchers make sure that the a UX designer understands the customer
        well while creating a design. They research deeply about what a user
        wants, what is their motive behind using the app and what will keep them
        coming back. <br /><br />
        With the advancement of IOT(Internet of Things) devices worldwide, many
        established organisations and startups are in search for designers who
        can build the next generation of websites, mobile apps and IoT
        interfaces, to be precise their task is to focus on THE NEXT BILLION
        USERS. <br /><br />
        This need makes the job of UX designers/Researcher highly in demand and
        the job growth for these professionals is expected to rise dramatically
        with a remarkable amount over the next ten years. <br /><br />
        Afterall, companies have realized the importance of investment in
        customer’s experience. Intentional and strategic user experience holds
        the potential to boost conversion rates.
